# Performance profiling notes

This directory holds before/after snapshots for the entity latency
optimization track (T05). Do not file general benchmark runs here —
those go to `docs/benchmark.md`. This directory is for targeted work
that moves the p99 needle on `/v1/entity/{type}/{id}`.

## Tooling

- `scripts/profile_entity.py` — client-side latency harness. Hits one
  entity endpoint `N` times at fixed concurrency and prints a JSON
  summary with `p50_ms`, `p95_ms`, `p99_ms`, throughput, and raw counts.
  This is the cheapest way to check "did my change move the needle"
  without spinning up the full Locust matrix.
- `scripts/run_benchmark.py` — full Locust matrix across the whole API
  surface. Slower to start, canonical source of the release baseline.
- `py-spy` — external sampling profiler. Attach to the live uvicorn
  process (no restart required) and record a flamegraph.
- `.github/perf-history.json` + `make perf-plot` — rolling trend of
  the aggregate load-test metrics. Useful for spotting slow drifts.

## Recommended workflow for a hypothesis

1. Start the API in a clean terminal: `make demo` (or equivalent). Note
   the uvicorn PID.
2. Capture a baseline:
   ```bash
   python scripts/profile_entity.py \
     --host http://localhost:8000 \
     --entity-type order \
     --entity-id ORD-20260401-7829 \
     --iterations 2000 \
     --concurrency 16 \
     --output docs/perf/entity-latency-before.json
   ```
3. Start a flamegraph sampler in parallel:
   ```bash
   py-spy record --pid <uvicorn-pid> --duration 30 --output docs/perf/flamegraph-before.svg
   ```
4. Drive the same load against the API while `py-spy record` is active
   (re-run step 2 without `--output` is fine).
5. Apply the code change. Restart `make demo`.
6. Repeat steps 2 and 3 with `-after` suffixes.
7. Compare the two `entity-latency-*.json` files; if p99 improved by
   less than 5%, drop the change per the T05 ground rule.

## File naming

- `entity-latency-<label>.json` — harness output for one run.
- `flamegraph-<label>.svg` — py-spy flamegraph for one run.
- `entity-profile-<label>.md` — written by hand, summarizes the top 20
  functions from the flamegraph plus the hypothesis being evaluated.

`label` is usually `before`, `after`, or a hypothesis slug like
`sqlglot-cache`.

## Ground rules

- Compare runs on the same hardware, with the demo stack in the same
  state, back-to-back. Numbers across different machines do not mean
  anything.
- Warm up the API before the measured window (the harness does 20
  warmup hits by default).
- If a hypothesis does not beat the 5% threshold, do not commit it —
  park the branch and move to the next hypothesis.
