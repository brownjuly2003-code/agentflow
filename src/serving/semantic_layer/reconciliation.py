"""Reconciliation checks — R1 ``journal_vs_store``, R2 ``stuck_replay``

Pure, read-only cross-store consistency probes: both functions read via the
QueryEngine/ControlPlaneStore ports only and never write serving state (I10)
— the caller (``routers/ops.py``) turns findings into overlay upserts and
owns the dedupe-key -> ``item_id`` mapping (``rc:<dedupe_key>``, §4.4).
